# API Integration Task (MD-Labs)

Develop a simple weather app with the following functionalities:

## User Input

* Allow users to enter a city name in a text field.

## API Call

* Integrate with a free weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch weather data for the entered city.
* Use an HTTP client or a networking library to make the API call.

## Data Parsing

* Parse the received JSON response to extract relevant weather information (e.g., temperature, description, icon).

## Data Display

* Display the retrieved weather information (city name, temperature, description, icon) on the screen.

## Error Handling

* Implement basic error handling for cases like invalid city name or network issues.
* Display a user-friendly message in case of errors.

1. Clone the repository using `git clone <git-repo-url>`.
